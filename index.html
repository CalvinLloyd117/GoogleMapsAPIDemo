                <p>During my first several months as a research assistant for the Blackfoot Research Project, I was tasked with two primary goals, the second of which was learning about the Google Maps API and the features and customization options we have
                    at our disposal. In order to convey location data related to the artifacts in a visual way, we required a platform which gave us the flexibility we needed; Google Maps was the obvious choice for such a job. Google Maps is one of the
                    most popular maps platforms out there, which means that users of the site will likely already be familiar with Google Maps, and prior knowledge will reduce the learning curve associated with using the maps on the website. Google Maps
                    suited our needs perfectly in this regard.</p>
                <p>Prior to my research into the Google Maps platform, I had no experience with Google Maps as a developer, only as a user. I took several tutorials on using the Google Maps JavaScript API, and quickly began experimenting with the features
                    that Google provides. I learned how to place markers, create info windows, and customize the aesthetic of the map through styling. Due to the importance of map aesthetics for the project, I really wanted to identify what was possible
                    in terms of customization, and what was not. While Google Maps does offer quite a lot customization options, there are certain portions that offer very little. For example, info windows themselves offer virtually nothing in terms of
                    aesthetic customization, though their content is quite flexible. </p>
                <p>Another area of exploration within Google Maps was how expandable it is, as well as how straightforward it is to add to it later on. Due to additional artifacts being potentially added to the collection later, it was crucial that the map
                    could be easily manipulated later. I created several basic functions which were aimed at facilitating additions to the maps, such as easily adding markers, etc. This research translated reasonably well to the React version of Google
                    Maps which is currently being used for the development of the site. Due to the inherent differences between Google Maps’ JavaScript API, and the library used within React, there are several features presented on this demo site that
                    may not be possible. However, the majority of features are included, and the ease of adding to, and manipulating the maps in React is a valuable tradeoff. React is able to handle the expansion of the site extremely well, and adding
                    additional artifacts to the site in general, and by extension Google Maps is much easier, requiring no changes or additions to be made to site’s code.</p>

                <h1>Google Maps Basics</h1>
                <p>Google maps have a huge number of customizable features. There is no way that it would be possible to demonstrate every feature. Partly due to the density of what Google maps offers. Furthermore, Google maps offers an API, which allows
                    me to utilize Google's Maps systems to create my own functions. Programming examples would be quite time consuming, especially if they were for features we would never consider using.
                </p>
                <h2>Basic Map Construction</h2>
                <p>Google provides the <i>initMap()</i> callback function, inwhich all of the map(s) and their operations are performed.</p>
                <p>Maps are constructed using <i>new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), options)</i> which takes two arguments.</p>
                <p>The first is the div container (id) where the map is to be put. The <i>options</i> is an object literal, which contains information such as initial zoom, mapTypeId, center location, and more.</p>
                <h2>Locations</h2>
                <p>In general, locations are stored as a latLng JS litteral (not to be confused with a json, though the syntax is shockingly similar). </p>
                <h2>Markers</h2>
                <p>Markers can be added to a given map dynamically using a home-made function. I have set up these methods to be as flexible as possible, allowing for easy insertion of markers, while keeping the html relatively clean from unnecessary JS
                    clutter.
                </p>
                <p><i>function addMarker(map, location, options = {})</i></p>
                <p>This function takes three arguments. The first, <i>map</i> is a Google map, being the map to which the marker will be added. Second, <i>location</i> is a latLng object, which denotes the location to be added. <i>options</i> is a styling
                    literal, which includes things like info for info-windows, marker type, and iconImage. Options can even be ignored, and default parameters will be applied. All parameters also follow a hierarchy. For example, if both <i>type</i> and
                    <i>iconImage</i> are supplied in options, the iconImage will take precedence over type. </i>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="map-container" id="map">
            </div>
            <div class="text-container">
                <h1>Shapes</h1>
                <p>The circles inparticular would be excellent for the purposes of indicating the general, or best estimate location, of where the artifacts were found, where materials could be from (with respect to Blackfoot knowledge transfer, but this
                    is just an example). Markers on the otherhand would be great for indicating exact locations of the museums or other points of interest. Of course, both circles and markers are fully customizable.</p>
                <p><i>function addCircle(map, location, options, radius)</i></p>
                <p>Function takes in 4 arguments (the first three being the same as the marker function) as well as <i>radius</i> which controls the size of the circle to be added.</p>
                <h1>UI and UX</h1>
                <p>Google also give control over the default UI aswell as some UX features. UI elements can be replaced with custom button styles, or removed from the map entirely. </p>
                <p>For UX, accidental map zooming can be prevented by setting gestureHandling: 'cooperative'. This also prevents one-finger panning on mobile.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I have made a restriction which solved an issue I was having with the display properties of the map. In general, this change limits how far users can zoom out of the map, aswell as how far they are able to pan out of the
                    map. This prevents the ugly grey area outside of the map from being visible.</p>
                <p>Additionally, a restriction was added to prevent multiple info-windows from being displayed at the same time. Clicking and opening a second shape/marker will replace the first info-window.</p>
